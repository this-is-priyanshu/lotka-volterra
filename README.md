# Lotka-Volterra model
This project implements the Lotka-Volterra model, also known as the predator-prey equations. The model simulates the interaction between two species in a habitat: one as prey and the other as a predator, illustrating the changes in population dynamics over a period of time.
### Features
- Uses Runge-Kutta method of 4th order (RK4 method) to solve the system of equations
- Real-time graph plotting of prey and predator populations over time
- Sliders to dynamically adjust values of different constants and observe real-time changes
###### Users are requested to input the default values as given on the page (since those are hardcoded by default). Values can be changed using sliders after the graph is plotted.
### Technologies Used
- **HTML, CSS**: For the web interface
- **JavaScript**: For implementing the numerical method to solve the system
- **Plotly.js**: For interactive graph plotting
###### Note: It is recommended to open this project on a computer, as the interface may get distorted on a smartphone/tablet screen.
